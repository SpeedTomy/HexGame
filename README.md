# HexGame
 This project aimed to recreate a variant of the Hex game in C. Hex is a two-player strategy game on a hexagonal board, where each player tries to connect opposite sides with a continuous line of their pieces. I added two modes: random mode, with pieces placed randomly at the start, and special mode, with unique moves.
